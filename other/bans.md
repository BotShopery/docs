# Bans and Strikes

Bans are issued when a user reaches the **third strike**. Some bans may be manually done \(for `$bug` abuse, for example\).

A strike is issued when the [Terms of Service](tos.md) are not respected. They are issued by an [Employee](../ranks.md#employee-team) or higher.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you would like to appeal one of your strikes, or even appeal your ban, please contact someone from the [Leading Team](../ranks.md#leading-team) by joining our [Discord server](https://amaury.xyz/discord).
{% endhint %}
