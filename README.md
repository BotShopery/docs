Hey there! Welcome in Shopery's documentation. If you're here, you probably were interested by our bot, or you just wanted some documentation.

Shopery is a bot that simulates a real delivery process. You order something, employees make it for you and deliver it into your server directly in a picture. It was made by **Amaury\#8490**, french aspiring developer.
